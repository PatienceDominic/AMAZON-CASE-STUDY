### AMAZON-CASE-STUDY
The Amazon case study  presents an exploratary data analysis and dashboards visualization of Amazon product listing, analyzing  product and customer review data to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies and customer engagement. This is designed during my learning process at DSA Incubator

### PROJECT CONTEXT
Client Name: RetailTech Insights
Industry: E-commerce Analytics
Role: Junior Data Analyst
Tools Used: Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Conditional Formating, Slicers, Cards)

### DATASETS OVERVIEW
 - Total Records : 1,466 
 - Fields 16
 - Source of Datasets DSA  Canvas LMS
 - Contents of the datasets are
     - Product details(Name, Category, Price, Discounts)
     - User engagement metrics ( Review count, Ratings)
     - Price variations and Revenue potential

  ### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
  This involves exploring the dataset to answer questions like
   - what is the average discount percentage by product category?
   - how many products are listed under each category?
   - What is the total number of reviews per category?
   - Which products have the highest average rating?
   - What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
   - Which product have the highest number of reviews?
   - what is the total potential rvevenue by category?
   - How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
   - Which category have products with the highest discount?

### Dashboard Highlights
This analysis was visualized using bar charts, line charts, donout, pie chart and column chart.


### INSIGHTS FROM THE PIVOT TABLES AND BUSINESS INSIGHTS

Based on the Average discount percentage by category
 - Target high discount categories for promotions and inventory movement
 - Top Discounted Category  - Electronic?wearable = 70.2% percntage discount followed by Electronic/earphones - 59.1%
The overall average discount percentage  across all ctegories  is 56.47%
Focus should be on advertising, clearance sales and promotional bundles on categories like wearable and headphones which have very high discount levels.
Also aggressive price competition. Thses categories can be used in flash sales, cross sell bundle with mobile device or laptops. Incentivized upsells e.g buy a phone, get 60% off on headphones.
- The category "Electronics|Headphones" alone accounts for nearly 20% of the total reviews, This suggests a high customer engagement and interest in headphones. Hence there should be more focus on marketing efforts, promotions or product expansions in the headphones segment. Also consider analyzing the sentiment of these reviews to identify what features customers value most(e.g sound quality,battery life, comfort).
- Electronics|Homtheat and Electronics|Mobiles have the highest actual prices but their discounts bring them significantly. This shows these higher-ticket items rely heavily on discounting to drive sales, Hence the discount strategy has to be reviewed but for lower priced categories like Electronics|Headphones and homeaudio consider if smaller discount might still be enough to attract buyers, seeing that the percentage discount is very steep.
- Most products have ratings clustered between 4.0 and 4.3(with the highest count at 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3). Very few products ar rted as 4.4 or as low as 3.8-3.9.This suggest that while prodect ratings are generally good, very few products stands out as top-rated. Hence identify he products that already  have  the highest ratings(4.4), analyze what makes them stand out(e.g features, quality, price customer support).
